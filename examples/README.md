# Examples
This folder contains some examples and evaluations of the model tree code.

## Running the examples
The easiest way to run the examples is to download the files into your 
project, to install the `modeltree` package and to run the notebooks.  
For your convenience, it is also possible to check the repository out, 
install just the requirements (without the modeltree package) and run the examples right from the examples folder.

__Note:__ You might need to install further packages, such as `jupyter`
to be able to run the examples.  
__Note:__ The examples automatically download missing datasets. 
So please ensure that you have a working internet connection as long as datasets are missing.
